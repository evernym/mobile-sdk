# Base Concepts

## Overview

### Connections

Connection is a connection between ... and ... . Simply, during connection both parts exchange their public keys that will be used during later communtications.

### Messages

Messages are the main way to exchange data wthin connection.

### Credentials

Credential is a set of information provided by ... . In most cases it consists of key-value pairs "credential type" - "credential value".

### Proofs

Proof request is the request to provide some data.
In most cases this data is taken from issued credentials

### Questions

Question is the request to provided one of the predefined answers from specified question.

## libVcx overview

### Message receving 

libVcx allows two types of message receiving:

#### Polling

With polling every message and state changes should be performed manually.

#### Push notifications.

libVcx could be configured to use notification services to receive new messsages. In this case messages and updates will be sent in real time .
Push notification will contain following attributes in  message  body:
- `@type`: type for push notification message. It can be: `cred`, `credOffer`, `proofReq` and `Question`. For structured messages, type of the push notification will be `Question`.
- `@uid`: identifier for specific message we are receiving
- `@forDID`: identifier for connection fom which notification was sent

When push notification message is received, we will need to call **downloadMessages** in VCX library, with providing uid and forDid details from notification body.  

> **NOTE**: Current Android sample app provides only polling code samples.

### Serialization and deserialization

Inside libVcx library, all entities (connections, proofs, etc.) presented as state machines. Every mutating operation, e.g. accepting or rejecting, changes internal state of this state machine.

Mobile device is known by it's limited resources and aggresive memory freeing in case of low RAM or application suspending. Because of this, entity state machines should be persisted to avoid data loss.

libVcx allows this entities to be **serialized** into string reprepsentation which could be easily persisted.\ 
String representations could be **deserialized** by libVcx to entity state machine and perform various operations with it. Deserialization process returns **handle** integer value.

Most of the operations with entities has following flow (in example of credential offer):

* Deserialize credeintial string and receive credential handle
* Using credential handle perform necessary operation (e.g. accept). 
* Serialize credential using credential handle
* Save resulting string for future use.
