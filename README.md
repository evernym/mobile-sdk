Connecting and exchanging encrypted data between agency (server side) and edge client (mobile application) is happening through several steps and via secured, encrypted protocol library (VCX). 

After project setup and adding dependency libraries, that communication consists of several different steps and they are: 

1. [Initialize mobile SDK](1.ProjectSetup.md) - VCX library in app runtime 
2. [Initialize wallet](2.IntializingTheWallet.md) and communication with specific agency (web server)
3. [Accepting invitation and establish connection](3.Connections.md) with entity  
4. [Accepting offered credential(s)](4.Credentials.md)
5. [Accepting and responding to proof request(s)](5.Proofs)
6. [Exchanging secured structured messages](6.StructuredMessages.md)
