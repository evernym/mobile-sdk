# 2. Initializing the Wallet and Cloud Agent

High Level Overview of steps

1. Create a sponsor service/endpoint on your app's backend. Here is a minimal [sample](https://github.com/evernym/mobile-sdk/tree/master/simple-sponsor)
2. Ask Evernym to onboard you as a Sponsor. Check below for more details
3. Complete mobile SDK [project setup guide](./1.ProjectSetup.md) first
4. From your mobile app call your sponsor backend API (service setup in Step 1) to get provision token
5. Call Evernym mobile SDK provision API with provided token to obtain a Cloud Agent
6. Call Evernym mobile SDK to initialize library

All above steps are explained in detail in this document.

## Introduction

Using the Evernym mobile SDK currently requires that the SDK be connected to and rely on a cloud agent that is hosted and provisioned at Evernym. In the future, this Evernym cloud agent will be replaceable with your own, one from a different vendor but still usable with the Evernym mobile SDK. This agent is used for its store-and-forward services, persistence and availability and ability to push notify to a device or forward via http to the appropriate sponsor. By default, Evernym’s hosted cloud services are locked down. In order for your mobile SDK instance to prove that it has permission to provision a new hosted cloud agent (one unique cloud agent per installation of your mobile app), you must provide a provisioning token.

## Definitions

- Sponsor \
   You are the sponsor. You as the `Sponsor` are the application owner using the mobile sdk to `Sponsor` individual app installs e.g. Example Credit Union is the `Sponsor` using the Evernym mobile SDK inside their own mobile app. Also `Sponsor` should have backend server that will perform token issuing. A sponsor provides a provision token so that their customers can provide authorization with Evernym's cloud agent.

> **Example** Credit Union is the Sponsor using the Evernym mobile SDK inside their own mobile app.
  
- Sponsee \
    Your customer's individual App installation on mobile device.

> **Example**  The app on Ryan’s phone is a Sponsee. He is an Example Credit Union member installing Example CU’s mobile app (`Sponsor`)  

- Evernym Cloud Service \
    Evernym hosted cloud service which facilitates provisioning and management of cloud agents - Evernym tokenizer service, provisioning protocol, agent management for all other protocols

- VCX Config: The list of options can be set in the config JSON passed to `vcx_get_provision_token` and `vcx_provision_agent_with_token` functions
    can be found in [the document](./Configuration.md).

- Provision Token \
    This token is provided by you as a `Sponsor` to enable provisioning of one of your customers (`Sponsee`) on an Evernym hosted cloud agent.

    ```json
     {
       "sponseeId":     String,
       "sponsorId":     String,
       "nonce":         String,
       "timestamp":     String,
       "sig":           String,
       "sponsorVerKey": String,
     } 
    ```

    Provision Token Fields

    - `sponseeId`:
     An identifier you as a `Sponsor` use to identify/reference your customer the `Sponsee`. This can be a customer id used to identify the customer (`Sponsee`) in your (`Sponsor`) back end database. In other words, this is an ID of an app user.
    - `sponsorId`:
     An ID given to you from Evernym's Support Team after the `Sponsor` onboarding process is complete.  
    - `nonce`:
    Randomly generated string. Used as one-time security token during registration. \
    **Example**. `random.number.toString()`
    - `timestamp`:
    An RFC 3339 and ISO 8601 date and time string such as `1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00`.
    - `sig`:
    You will provide a signature to your customer (the `Sponsee`) so that they can provision with Evernym's Cloud Agent. You (The `Sponsor`) will:  
        1. create a string by concatenating in this order `nonce + timeStamp + sponseeId + sponsorId`
        2. sign the resulting string with the keys registered during the onboarding process. The keys that match the configured `sponsorVerKey`.
        3. Base64 encode the result of the signature
    **Example** Base64Encode(Sign(nonce + timeStamp + sponseeId + sponsorId))
    - `sponsorVerKey`:
    This is the key you as the `Sponsor` provided to Evernym's support team during onboarding. You (`Sponsor`) can register multiple keys during onboarding so this identifies which key to use during authorization. This key is not used unless a corresponding one is found in the configuration.

Simple server performing provision token signing and provision token generation could be found [here](https://github.com/evernym/mobile-sdk/tree/master/simple-sponsor).

## Sponsor (i.e. You) Onboarding with Evernym's Cloud Service

- In order for you to register as a `Sponsor`, contact `support@evernym.com`.
- Onboarding/Registration requires you (the `Sponsor`) to provide these attributes to Evernym's support team. Please include them in your email to support@evernym.com:
    1. Name you want for your onboarded sponsor
    2. Verification Keys: List (1 or many) of your `Sponsor` VerKeys (verification key or public key) associated with the signing of the token. This is used to verify and authenticate a customer's (`Sponsee`) provision token during the provisioning on Evernym's Cloud Service.
       - The signing keys (including the `verkey` shared with Evernym's Cloud Service) can be generated using this simple tool: `https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/launch/raw/master/sovrin-keygen.zip`
       - The Private keys need to be stored in a safe place under control your (`Sponsor's`) control. You should not send private key in email.
       - The public `verkey` should be shared with Evernym for signature validation.
    3. endpoint: Your (`Sponsor's`) URL that Evernym Cloud Service should forward customer (`Sponsee`) messages to. This is how you can add push notifications to your mobile app. Evernym does not host a push notification service for the mobile SDK, you must create and manage your own. Evernym cloud agents will forward messages to this endpoint for you to push notify to your app.

## Mobile SDK Customer Provisioning Overview

1. Get Provision Token
    - You as the `Sponsor` will need to sign a provision token for your customer (`Sponsee`). Your app will have to communicate with you (`Sponsor`) to receive a `token`.
    - This `token` will contain a signature generated by you (`Sponsor`) to ensure the customer's app (`Sponsee`) has authorization to do so.
    - The `sig` field in [Token Fields](2.Initialization.md#provision-token-fields) describes how to sign a token.
    - It also contains a timestamp. If the token isn’t delivered to Evernym's Cloud Service in a predefined time frame, the token will be invalid. Your customer's app (`Sponsee`) will need to request another `token` from you (`Sponsor`).
    - If for whatever reason provisioning fails, your customer's app (`Sponsee`) should request a new `token` from you (`Sponsor`) and attempt provisioning again.
2. Provisioning
    - Once your app has provision token, you need to use function for provisioning with token.
    - This API expects two parameters of string type. These strings are JSON stringified objects which have following format

        ```json
        vcx_config: { - VCX library config 
            // Target Agency
            agency_url: string, // url of agency to connect
            agency_did: string, // did of agency
            agency_verkey: string, // verkey of agency
            // Creating Wallet 
            wallet_name: string, // name of wallet
            wallet_key: string, // key to be used for wallet encryption
            // Pool Ledger
            path: string, // path to file containing pool genesis transactions
            // User Meta
            logo: string, // url leading to image
            name: string, // name to use
            // Communication Protocol
            protocol_type: '3.0', // communication protocol
            // it can be extended with other configuration options (see Configuration.md document)
            ...
        }
        token: { - Token received from Sponsor
           sponseeId:     String,
           sponsorId:     String,
           nonce:         String,
           timestamp:     String,
           sig:           String,
           sponsorVerKey: String,
        }
        ```

    - The value returned from this api (it can be ) will be the input for VCX init function. 
    At this point, the app will be provisioned on Evernym's Cloud Service with a cloud agent and will have a local wallet initialized but NOT open. Vcx init will open the wallet.

3. Receiving Your customer's Future Messages

    There is two strategies regarding receiving messages by an application:
    
    * Polling - Customer application once in a while calls Cloud Agent to get all received messages. 
        ![](./wiki-images/Polling.png)
        
        This strategy is used in the sample applications.

    * Push Notifications - Cloud Agent forwards messages to `Sponsor` which then notifies application. Go to the [document](./PushNotifications.md) to get more information regarding setting push notifications.
        ![](./wiki-images/PushNotifications.png)

## Application Initialization Steps

Overview:
1. Prepare Application environment data:
    * Agency information
    * Pool Ledger Network genesis transactions
1. On **first** application init:
    * Create a directory where wallet will be located.
    * (Optionally) Generate wallet key
    * (Optionally) Configure and init logger
    * Call VCX function to provision an Agent
        * iOS - `agentProvisionWithToken`
        * Android - `UtilsApi.vcxAgentProvisionWithToken`
    * Store for next usage.
    * Call VCX function to initialize library with received JSON config
        * iOS - `initWithConfig`
        * Android - `VcxApi.vcxInitWithConfig`
1. On **second and other** application init:
    * Read provisioned JSON config received after **first** application init.
    * Call VCX function to initialize library with prepared JSON config
        * iOS - `initWithConfig`
        * Android - `VcxApi.vcxInitWithConfig`

### Errors you might see while calling `agentProvisionWithToken`

- **GNR-115**: This `statusCode` is returned when your `sponsor` details are not saved on agency which you are trying to use. To resolve this problem, send an email as described in section `Sponsor (i.e You) onboarding` above in this file
- **GNR-117**: This `statusCode` tells that the `provisioningToken` is already used. So, app should call your Sponsor token endpoint, and get a new provisioning token. Then call `agentProvisionToken` again with new token.

#### iOS

Refer to [AppDelegate.m](Examples/ios/CMeSdkObjc/CMeSdkObjc/AppDelegate.m).

#### Android

Refer to [ConnectMeVcx#init()](Examples/android/CMeSdkJava/lib/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/ConnectMeVcx.java#L65).

1. libVcx uses `slf4j` logging library. \
    Sample of configuration to store libVcx logs in specified file could be found [here](Examples/android/CMeSdkJava/lib/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/ConnectMeVcx.java#L114).\
    For additional information about logging configuration see [slf4j documentation](http://www.slf4j.org/docs.html).

2. Genesis transaction pool used to configure network could be found [here](Examples/android/CMeSdkJava/app/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/sample/Constants.java#L5). This configuration targets *production* network.\ 
    In case your app works with other network, corresponding genesis transaction files for different environment could be found
[here](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/tree/master/sovrin). 
    This files should be saved on filesystem and be accessible to libVcx. For sample, [ConnectMeVcx#writeGenesisFile()](Examples/android/CMeSdkJava/lib/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/ConnectMeVcx.java#L150).

3. On first init (if you don't have populated JSON config) following steps should be performed:

    1. Create directory where wallet will be located.

    2. Generate wallet key. See [ConnectMeVcx#createWalletKey()](Examples/android/CMeSdkJava/lib/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/ConnectMeVcx.java#L186).

    3. Prepare agency configuration JSON using wallet name, key and wallet directory path (see [config sample](#config-sample)).

    4. Call `UtilsApi#vcxAgentProvisionWithToken()` with prepared config to fill necessary fields.

    5. Add additional fields to resulting JSON (see [ConnectMeVcx#populateConfig()](Examples/android/CMeSdkJava/lib/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/ConnectMeVcx.java#L138) for example and the [document](./Configuration.md) to get the list of all options).

    6. Resulting JSON must be stored for latter usage. This JSON will be used to initialize libVcx.
    
4. On second and other application initializations you must skip 3 step and directly initialize libVcx (see [ConnectMeVcx#initialize()](Examples/android/CMeSdkJava/lib/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/ConnectMeVcx.java#L248) with stored configuration JSON (result of 3 step on first init).
 
> **NOTE:** If the initialization of the wallet does not work after you followed these steps, please contact Evernym. If you had to do extra steps to get it working, please also let us know what you had to do so that we can update this document.

## Selecting the Ledger and Cloud Service

### Ledger

If you want to use a different Ledger, you *must* change to the corresponding Evernym Cloud Service as described in the *Evernym Cloud Service* section below.

1. Change the agency configuration object according to Ledger you want to use. Evernym has several active Ledger instances, but in most cases you will use one of these two:
   - [**`demo`**](DemoEnvironment.md): for testing purposes during development and
   - [**`prod`**](ProductionEnvironment.md): production environment, for app releases in AppStores.

2. Use the `poolConfig:` setting in the particular environment to set the `poolTxnGenesis` variable to the value of the `poolConfig:` setting. If you  want to use a different Ledger other than `demo`, which is what the above code uses, then please let us know.

### Evernym Cloud Service

If you choose to use a different Ledger then you *must* change to the corresponding Evernym Cloud Service and vice-versa.

- To use a different Evernym Cloud Service, change the contents of the `agencyConfig` variable in the above code. 

- For every different Ledger configuration there is a corresponding Evernym Cloud Service configuration. These configuration settings can be seen in the same `config-store.js` code that was linked in the Ledger section above. 

- You will need to change `agency_did`, `agency_url`, and `agency_verkey` in the code above to use a different Evernym Cloud Service for the corresponding Ledger.

    "agency_verkey": "844sJfb2snyeEugKvpY7Y4jZJk9LT6BnS6bnuKoiqbip", // Verification key of the agency

    //These fields are used for wallet configuration
    "wallet_name": "name", // Name of the wallet
    "wallet_key": "key", // Wallet key
    "storage_config": { // Wallet storage config
        "path": "/path/to/wallet", // Path to the wallet directory
    }
}
```
