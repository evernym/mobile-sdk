# 2. Storage

Mobile devices are known for their limited resources and aggressive memory freeing in case of low RAM or application suspension.

As we reflected before at [Base Concepts document](./0.BaseConcepts.md), inside SDK library all entities (connections, credentials, etc.) represented as state machines.
The most of the operations with SDK you will be performing with these state machines.

### How to work with state machines

Mobile SDK separates state machine transitions, and their persistence because it gives us some benefits:
* flexibility regarding what storage will be used to store data.
* flexibility regarding what information objects will be stored.
* reduction of data loss chance as the application stores data once.

The state machines are pointed by an integer **handle**.
You will be passing a handle to perform some operations with a state machine.
Every mutating operation, e.g. accepting or rejecting, changes the internal state of the state machine referenced by the passed handle moving in into the next state.\
Once the state of the state machine changes it's better to save it into the application storage.\
The state machines can be **serialized** into **JSON string** representation.

The next time you want to perform some operation with a state machine, its string representation should be taken from the application storage and **deserialized** by SDK to the entity state machine.
The deserialization process returns new **handle** integer value pointing to recreated state machine object.

Most of the operations with entities has following flow:
* Create Credential state machine based on Credential Offer and perform some operations.
* Serialize state machine and save resulting string into application storage for future use.
* Later when you need to do something with Credential state machine (e.g. you received a next message related to protocol) - deserialize the credential state machine from string and receive a new handle.
* With the usage of received handle perform a necessary operation (e.g. handle next message from the protocol).
* Serialize new credential state machine state into string.
* Save resulting string for future use.

In the following documents, we will highlight which operations mutate state machines and when you need save their serialized representation into application storage. 

### Information stored by Mobile SDK  

Despite the fact that Mobile SDK does not persist state machines it still has its own secure Wallet storage where it automatically securely save some pieces of secret information in encrypted form which cannot be read.
* **private key** which will be used to encrypt messages sent to your Cloud Agent. It will be created and sored during Cloud Agent provisioning  step.
* **private keys** which will be used to encrypt messages sent to another User. It will be created and sored  during Connection establishing step.
* **credential master secret** which will be used for credentials blinding during the issuance process. It will be created and sored once on the first SDK initialization.
* **credential signatures**  which will be created by unblinding of a credential signature received from an issuer during the issuance process. It will be created and stored every time you receive a new credential.

In the following documents, we will explain the meaning of these secrets in more details.

### Storage

As we mentioned before, applications have to care about persisting of state machines and other data.
There are two options where to store your data:
* Mobile SDK Wallet - as we mentioned at [Information stored by Mobile SDK](#information-stored-by-mobile-sdk) section, Mobile SDK has its own secure Wallet storage to store secrets.
These secrets cannot be read but Mobile SDK also provides a set of functions to write/read any data into the Wallet. 
  
    > The information is written into the Wallet in encrypted form. That encryption slightly affects storage performance.

    > In order to use Mobile SDK Wallet to store application data, you don't need any additional configuration or steps. It will be available after SDK initialization.

* Platform-specific storage - you also can configure and use any storage available on your application platform. 
  
    > The work of some platform-specific storage can be faster than Mobile SDK Wallet. 
  
    > You have to implement storage configuration and integration by yourself in the application.

### Mobile SDK Wallet API

Mobile SDK Wallet is built on top of SQLite database applying additional encryption to the records.
There is a single table containing the following columns:
* `type` - entity type
* `id` - id of the record
* `value` - record value
* `tags` - record tags used for search and storing meta information as json `{ "tagName1": <str>, ...}`

The combination of `type` and `id` values must be unique.

* **Add a record to the Wallet**
    * ##### iOS
        ```objC
        (void)addRecordWallet:(NSString *)recordType
