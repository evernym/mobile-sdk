### 1. Get Question from pending messages

1. Download pending messages
   See [messages documentation](8.Messages.md) for messages downloading information. Pending messages with `question` or `committed-question` type should be used.

   #### Example of Question

    ```json
    {
        "@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/committedanswer/1.0/question",
        "@id": "5b4c8a32-ceae-48e1-bd6b-ffa2a07ddbf0",
        "question_text": "Hi, Thomas",
        "question_detail": "Are you on the phone with the credit union right now about transferring $100.00?",
        "valid_responses": [
          {
            "text": "Yes, I am",
            "nonce":
              "255c41413dcffcfaa4fe909cd65e477a5ed77d1550ba7f2c52cac58af84c4b8d"
          },
          {
            "text": "No, I am not",
            "nonce":
              "2a2a22bc64ecfda55fa40a2c9227c3592ac1399e63688b58d5f33c64b4326f77"
          }
        ],
        "@timing": {
          "expires_time": "2018-12-13T17:29:06+0000"
        }
      }
    ```
    
    From message payload following fields should be retrieved:

    * `@id` - ID of the message
    * `question_text` - Question to show to user
    * `question_details` - Additional details for question
    * `valid_responses` - Array of possible answers for question. Each entry has following fields:
        * `text` - Readable representation of valid response.
        * `nonce` - String that should be sent for selected response.

### 2. Update message status

1. Update status of correspondent message on the Agent as reviewed. See [messages documentation](8.Messages.md) for message update information.

### 3. Answer on received Question

1. Select response option to be used

   ```
   answerJson = JSON.toString({
      "text": "Yes, I am",
      "nonce": "255c41413dcffcfaa4fe909cd65e477a5ed77d1550ba7f2c52cac58af84c4b8d"
   })
   ```

1. Deserialize Connection state object associated with received Question message

    ### iOS
    ```objC
    [appDelegate.sdkApi connectionDeserialize:serializedConnection
            completion:^(NSError *error, NSInteger connectionHandle) {
                // ...
            }];
    ```
    
    ### Android
    ```java
    int connectionHandle = ConnectionApi.connectionDeserialize(serializedConnection).get();
    ```

1. Send answer message

    ### iOS
    ```objC
    [appDelegate.sdkApi connectionSendAnswer:connHandle
            question:questionJson
            answer:answerJson
            withCompletion:^(NSError *error) {
                // ...
            }];
    ```
    
    ### Android
    ```java 
    ConnectionApi.connectionSendAnswer(connHandle, questionJson, answerJson).get();
    ```
