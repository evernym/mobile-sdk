# 6. Proofs

Once a Holder received a verifiable credential he can use it to prove himself to someone else.
Credential verification protocol implemented using Zero-knowledge protocol.
During the credential verification process, the Holder generates digital proof which the Verifier can validate using published Issuer keys which he used during the issuance of the credential, which Holder used to generate the proof.\
Mobile SDK can generate an unlimited number of proof in this way.

There are two roles in the connection establishing process: **Verifier** and **Prover**.
* The Verifier is the party that ask Holder to provide some information about him. [Verity SDK](https://github.com/evernym/verity-sdk) can be used as an **Verifier**.
* The Prover is the party that generates proofs based on the previously sored credentials. **Mobile SDK** represents the **Holder** party. Bellow in this document we will explain which steps need to be taken in order to generate a Proof for received request on the **Prover** side using Mobile SDK.

> **NOTE:** library should be initialized before using proofs API. See [initialization documentation](3.Initialization.md)

> **NOTE:** there must be established connection between Prover and Verifier. See [connections document](5.Connections.md)

> **NOTE:** there must be at least on credential stored in the Holder's wallet. See [credentials document](6.Credentials.md)

## Proof Request Overview

Proof Request is a request sent by one of the communication sides to another one in order to get information about it.

There are three types of data that can be requested in a Proof Request:

#### Requested Attributes

Requested Attributes are fields that the sender wants to know exact values. Proof provided by another side will contain exact value and math evidence of their correctness.

#### Requested Attribute Groups

Requested Attribute Groups are similar to **Requested Attributes**. 
The only difference that they imply additional restriction for specified attributes: the same credential **must** be used for their proving.

#### Requested Predicates

Requested Predicates are conditions that the sender wants to ensure that receiver has a credential containing attribute which can resolve this condition but **without** revealing an actual value of this attribute.
Proof provided by another side will contain math evidence of the fact that he has a credential solving predicate condition, but there will not be shown an exact value used for solving this predicate. 

Predicates can be requested only over fields which has integer representation in a credential (e.x. predicate can be requested for credential field `age` with has value `20` but not `twenty`)

There are 4 types of supported predicates
* `>=` - greater or equal
* `>` - greater
* `<=` - less or equal
* `<` - less

> **NOTE**: Credentials do not specify units of measurement. 
There is a possible situation when the requested predicate, in theory, is resolvable but no credentials are returned by a library.
Example: credentials contains `height` with value `2` (implies maters) but requested predicate contains `p_value` as `170` (implies centimeters). 
For this case, it will be impossible to fulfill the proof request.

> **NOTE:** single proof can contain only part of used credential data

> **NOTE:** single  proof can contain data from multiple different credentials

## Responding to Proof Requests

Aries Present Proof protocol consists of several messages exchange:
* Verifier sends `Presentation Request` message to Prover
* Prover handles `Presentation Request` message and sends `Presentation` message to Verifier

### Steps overview

In order to handle a `Proof Request` a Prover (client) need to take the following steps:

1. Download and Parse Proof Offer Request message received from the Pairwise Cloud Agent.
2. Create Proof state object using parsed Proof Request message\
   2.1. Serialize Proof state object and save serialized representation\
   2.2. Update message (connected to Proof Request) status on the Agent as reviewed
3. Retrieve and select credentials which will be used for Proof Request filling
4. Generate and Share Proof\
   4.1. Deserialize associated Connection state object\
   4.2. Deserialize Proof state object\
   4.3. Generate and Send Proof message\
   4.4. Serialize Proof state object and save serialized representation
5. Reject Proof Request\
   5.1. Deserialize associated Connection state object\
   5.2. Deserialize Proof state object\
   5.3. Send Proof Reject message\
   5.4. Serialize Proof state object and save serialized representation

### 1. Get Proof Request from pending messages

1. Download pending messages (see [messages documentation](4.MessagesFlow.md) for messages downloading information). Pending messages with `proof request` type should be used.  Extract Proof Request JSON string from the downloaded message (value of `decryptedPayload` field).

   #### Example of Proof Request

    ```json
    {
       "@id":"d7f98364-2995-413d-8d20-ee1c817e1dd2",
       "@type":"did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/present-proof/1.0/request-presentation",
       "comment":"Basic Info",
       "request_presentations~attach":[
          {
             "@id":"libindy-request-presentation-0",
             "data":{
                "base64":"eyJuYW1lIjoicHJvb2ZfZnJvbV9hbGljZSIsIm5vbl9yZXZva2VkIjpudWxsLCJub25jZSI6IjkyNDAzNDI1OTA1OTQ2MzEzNTQwODk2NyIsInJlcXVlc3RlZF9hdHRyaWJ1dGVzIjp7ImF0dHJpYnV0ZV8wIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJNZW1iZXJJRCJ9fSwicmVxdWVzdGVkX3ByZWRpY2F0ZXMiOnt9LCJ2ZXIiOiIxLjAiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoiMS4wIn0="
             },
             "mime-type":"application/json"
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

   The following fields can be used to show the proof request on the UI:
    * `comment` - title of proof request

2. Fetch Proof Request attachment content because it contains requested attributes and predicates:
   ### iOS
    ```objc
    [appDelegate.sdkApi extractAttachedMessage: proofRequest
            completion:^(NSError *error, NSString *attachedMessage) {
                // ...
            }];
    ```

   ### Android

    ```java
    int proofHandle = UtilsApi.vcxExtractAttachedMessage(proofRequest).get();
    ```

   #### Example of Proof Request attachment content

    ```json
    {
       "nonce": "220867029780621153091790",
       "name": "Basic Info",
       "version": "0.1",
       "requested_attributes": {
           "attribute_1": {
               "name": "Number"
           },
           "attribute_2": {
               "name": "First Name"
           }
       },
       "requested_predicates": {
           "predicate_1": {
               "name": "Age",
               "p_type": ">=",
               "p_value": 20
           }
       }
    }
    ```

The following fields can be used to show the proof request on the UI:
* `proof_request_data[name]` - title of proof request
* `proof_request_data[request_attributes]` - list of attributes requested for proof
* `proof_request_data[requested_predicates]` - list of predicates requested for proof

### 2. Create Proof state object using received Proof Request message

1. Create Credential state object

    ### iOS
    ```objc
    [appDelegate.sdkApi proofCreateWithRequest: sourceId
            withProofRequest: message
            completion:^(NSError *error, vcx_proof_handle_t credentailHandle) {
                // ...
            }];
    ```
    
    ### Android
    
    ```java
    int proofHandle = DisclosedProofApi.proofCreateWithRequest(sourceId, message).get();
    ```
    
    * `sourceId` - random string
    * `message` - message received on step 1

1. Serialize Proof state object

    ### iOS
    ```objc
    [appDelegate.sdkApi proofSerialize: proofHandle
            completion:^(NSError *error, NSString *proof_request) {
                // ...
            }];
    ```
    
    ### Android
    
    ```java
    String serializedProof = DisclosedProofApi.proofSerialize(proofHandle).get();
    ```

1. Store serialized Proof for latter operations. \
   It is up to the developer regarding what data to store in the application. On of the possible formats may match the following structure:

    ```
    {
        "pwDid" - string, // point to connection 
        "serialized" - string, // serialized SDK object
        "threadId" - string, // value of `thread_id` field. Identifier of present ptoof protocol.    
                             // This is needed to match the following messages related to the protocol instance.

        // metadata to show on the UI
        "title": string, // proof request title
        "request_attributes": json // list of attributes requested for proof
        "requested_predicates": json // list of predicates requested for proof
   
        "timestamp": int // optional, time of sharing a proof (it can be shown on the UI)      
        "status" - string, // proof status (pending / completed)
      }
   ```

1. Every time in the future you want to perform some operations using the created Proof object you need firstly to fetch Proof object from the storage and next deserialize SDK object from its serialized representation (receive a new handle).

1. Update status of correspondent message on the Agent as reviewed. See [messages documentation](4.MessagesFlow.md) for message update information.

### 3. Retrieve and select credentials for Proof Request filling

1. Deserialize Proof state object associated with Proof Request

    #### iOS
    ```objC
    [appDelegate.sdkApi proofDeserialize:serializedProof
            completion:^(NSError *error, NSInteger proofHandle) {
                // ...
            }];
    ```
    
    #### Android
    ```java
    int proofHandle = ProofApi.proofDeserialize(serializedProof).get();
    ```

1. Retrieve credentials which can be used to fill Proof Request

    ### iOS
    ```objc
    [appDelegate.sdkApi proofDeserialize: serializedProof
            completion:^(NSError *error, vcx_proof_handle_t proofHandle) {
                // ...
                [appDelegate.sdkApi proofRetrieveCredentials: proofHandle
                    withCompletion:^(NSError *error, NSString *retrievedCreds) {
                        // ...                    
                    }];
            }];
    ```
    
    ### Android
    
    ```java
    int proofHandle = DisclosedProofApi.proofDeserialize(serializedProof).get();
    String retrievedCreds = DisclosedProofApi.proofRetrieveCredentials(proofHandle).get();
    ```
    
    `retrievedCreds` field will contain JSON object with credentials available for proving of each requested attribute / predicate:

    ```json
    {
        "attrs": {
            "attribute_1": [
                {
                    "cred_info": {
                        "attrs": {
                            "Number": "12345",
                            "First Name": "Alice",
                            "Last Name": "Andersen",
                            "Age": "22"
                        },
                        "cred_def_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:3:CL:33627:tag1",
                        "cred_rev_id": null,
                        "referent": "79f68e11-0aaf-4891-8277-1f90f5b05670",
                        "rev_reg_id": null,
                        "schema_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:2:DEMO-Transcript:1.0"
                    },
                    "interval": null
                }
            ],
            "attribute_2": [
                {
                    "cred_info": {
                        "attrs": {
                            "Number": "12345",
                            "First Name": "Alice",
                            "Last Name": "Andersen",
                            "Age": "22"
                        },
                        "cred_def_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:3:CL:33627:tag1",
                        "cred_rev_id": null,
                        "referent": "79f68e11-0aaf-4891-8277-1f90f5b05670",
                        "rev_reg_id": null,
                        "schema_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:2:DEMO-Transcript:1.0"
                    },
                    "interval": null
                }
            ],
            "predicate_1": [
                {
                    "cred_info": {
                        "attrs": {
                            "Number": "12345",
                            "First Name": "Alice Andersen",
                            "Last Name": "Andersen",
                            "Age": "22"
                        },
                        "cred_def_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:3:CL:33627:tag1",
                        "cred_rev_id": null,
                        "referent": "79f68e11-0aaf-4891-8277-1f90f5b05670",
                        "rev_reg_id": null,
                        "schema_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:2:DEMO-Transcript:1.0"
                    },
                    "interval": null
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    > **NOTE**: Both (attributes and predicates) will be put under the same `attrs` field.

    > **NOTE**: In case any of the fields contain empty array, that means that no credentials available and accepting process cannot be proceeded further.

   > **NOTE**: There is no guaranty regarding the order of returned credentials for each requested attribute.  If you want to select the freshest credential as a default user selection you need to store an additional timestamp bent to credential id on the application side and sort credentials for requested attributes based on their timestamps.    

1. Select credentials to use for proving of requested attributes and predicates. Basically, you need to select single entry (credential info) for each requested attribute / predicate. 

    ```json
    {
        "attrs": {
            "attribute_1": {
                "credential": {
                    "cred_info": {
                        "attrs": {
                            "Number": "12345",
                            "First Name": "Alice",
                            "Last Name": "Andersen",
                            "Age": "22"
                        },
                        "cred_def_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:3:CL:33627:tag1",
                        "cred_rev_id": null,
                        "referent": "79f68e11-0aaf-4891-8277-1f90f5b05670",
                        "rev_reg_id": null,
                        "schema_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:2:DEMO-Transcript:1.0"
                    },
                    "interval": null
                }
            },
            "attribute_2": {
                "credential": {
                    "cred_info": {
                        "attrs": {
                            "Number": "12345",
                            "First Name": "Alice",
                            "Last Name": "Andersen",
                            "Age": "22"
                        },
                        "cred_def_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:3:CL:33627:tag1",
                        "cred_rev_id": null,
                        "referent": "79f68e11-0aaf-4891-8277-1f90f5b05670",
                        "rev_reg_id": null,
                        "schema_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:2:DEMO-Transcript:1.0"
                    },
                    "interval": null
                }
            },
            "predicate_1": {
                "credential": {
                    "cred_info": {
                        "attrs": {
                            "Number": "12345",
                            "First Name": "Alice",
                            "Last Name": "Andersen",
                            "Age": "22"
                        },
                        "cred_def_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:3:CL:33627:tag1",
                        "cred_rev_id": null,
                        "referent": "79f68e11-0aaf-4891-8277-1f90f5b05670",
                        "rev_reg_id": null,
                        "schema_id": "R9kuPrDFDVKNRL1oFpRxg2:2:DEMO-Transcript:1.0"
                    },
                    "interval": null
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

   See [Proofs#mapCredentials()](/examples/android/CMeSdkJava/lib/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/Proofs.java) for sample. Note that this method automatically takes first possible credential from available.

1. Fill in missing attributes which can be self attested by user (according to Proof Request).

    Proof could contain self-attested attributes list. 
    In this case JSON object with user-provided inputs should be constructed.
    
    > **NOTE:** In case self-attested attributes are not required, empty JSON array should be used: `{}`  

   Attributes can be self-attested if it matches to one of the conditions:
    * there is not any `restrictions` set for the attribute
    * `self_attest_allowed` is set as `true`

1. If user does not have a credential to fill in missing attributes, and these attributes cannot be self attested (according to Proof Request) you will not be able to generate Proof. So you can only reject received Proof Request.

### 4. Share Proof

In case user is able to fulfill received proof request, following steps should be performed to share proof.

1. Deserialize Connection state object associated with received Prof Request message

    #### iOS
    ```objC
    [appDelegate.sdkApi connectionDeserialize:serializedConnection
            completion:^(NSError *error, NSInteger connectionHandle) {
                // ...
            }];
    ```
    
    #### Android
    ```java
    int connectionHandle = ConnectionApi.connectionDeserialize(serializedConnection).get();
    ```

1. Deserialize Proof state object associated with Proof Request

    #### iOS
    ```objC
    [appDelegate.sdkApi proofDeserialize:serializedProof
            completion:^(NSError *error, NSInteger proofHandle) {
                // ...
            }];
    ```
    
    #### Android
    ```java
    int proofHandle = DisclosedProofApi.proofDeserialize(serializedProof).get();
    ```

1. Generate Proof using selected credentials and self attested attributes

    ### iOS
    ```objc
    [appDelegate.sdkApi proofGenerate: proofHandle
            withSelectedCredentials:selectedCredentials
            withSelfAttestedAttrs:selfAttestedAttributes
            completion:^(NSError *error) {
                // ...

## Proof Request data cases

This section shows different formats for Proof Requests that can be sent to credential holder.

1. Request single attribute:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name"
        },
    }
    ```

1. Request single attribute restricted by Issuer:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name",
            "restrictions": {"issuer_did": "ANM2cmvMVoWpk6r3pG5FAZ"}
        },
    }
   ```
       
1. Request single attribute restricted by list of Issuer's:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name",
            "restrictions": {"issuer_did": {"$in": ["ANM2cmvMVoWpk6r3pG5FAZ", "BNM2cmvMVoWpk6r3pG5FAZ"]}}
        },
    }
    ```
   
1. Request single attribute restricted by Credential Definition:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name",
            "restrictions": {|cred_def_id": "ANM2cmvMVoWpk6r3pG5FAZ:3:CL:1:1"}
        },
    }
    ```

1. Request single attribute that can be self attested:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name"
        },
    }
    // or 
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name",
            "self_attest_allowed": true
        },
    }
    ```

1. Request single attribute that cannot be self attested:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name"
            "self_attest_allowed": false
        },
    }
    // or set any restriction 
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name"
            "restrictions": {"issuer_did": "ANM2cmvMVoWpk6r3pG5FAZ"}
        },
    }
    ```

1. Request couple attributes which can be filled from different credentials:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "name": "Name"
        },
        "attribute_2": {
            "name": "Surname"
        },
    }
   ```
    
1. Request couple attributes which must be filled from the same credential:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "names": ["Name", "Surname"]
        },
    }
    ```

1. Request couple attributes which must be filled from the same credential and restricted by issuer:
    ```
    "requested_attributes": {
        "attribute_1": {
            "names": ["Name", "Surname"],
            "restrictions": {"issuer_did": "ANM2cmvMVoWpk6r3pG5FAZ"}
        },
    }
    ```

1. Request predicates:
    ```
    // Less or equal
    "requested_predicates": {
        "predicate_1": {
            "name": "Age", "p_type": "<=", "p_value": 30
        },
    }
    // Less
    "requested_predicates": {
        "predicate_1": {
            "name": "Age", "p_type": "<", "p_value": 30
        },
    }
    // Greater
    "requested_predicates": {
        "predicate_1": {
            "name": "Age", "p_type": ">", "p_value": 30
        },
    }
    // Greater or equal
    "requested_predicates": {
        "predicate_1": {
            "name": "Age", "p_type": ">=", "p_value": 30
        },
    }
    ```

1. Request predicates restricted by an issuer:
    ```
       "requested_predicates": {
        "predicate_1": {
            "name": "Age", "p_type": ">=", "p_value": 30,
            "restrictions": {"issuer_did": "ANM2cmvMVoWpk6r3pG5FAZ"}
        },
    }
    ```
