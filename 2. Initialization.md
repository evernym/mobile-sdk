# 2. Initializing the Wallet and Cloud Agent

Almost all of the iOS APIs provided by the Connect.Me iOS SDK are asynchronous, which means that a completion callback function is required to get the results of the function invocations. This page contains the steps to initialize the wallet and an Evernym Agency cloud agent. Most of these wallet initialization steps are done in the AppDelegate’s `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` lifecycle method. <!--[Q1] What about Android?-->

### Introduction
Using the Evernym mobile SDK currently requires that the SDK be connected to and rely on a cloud agent that is hosted and provisioned at Evernym. In the future, this Evernym cloud agent will be replaceable with your own, one from a different vendor but still usable with the Evernym mobile SDK. This agent is used for its store-and-forward services, persistence and availability and ability to push notify to a device. By default, Evernym’s hosted cloud services are locked down. In order for your mobile SDK instance to prove that it has permission to provision a new hosted cloud agent (one unique cloud agent per installation of your mobile app), you must provide a token.

### Definitions
- Sponsor \
   Application owner using the mobile SDK to sponsor individual app installs e.g. Example Credit Union is the Sponsor using the Evernym mobile SDK inside their own mobile app.
>   **Example** Credit Union is the Sponsor using the Evernym mobile SDK inside their own mobile app.

    
- Sponsee \
    Individual App install.
>   **Example**  The app on Ryan’s phone is a Sponsee. He is an Example Credit Union member installing Example CU’s mobile app (`sponsor`)  

- Evernym Agency \
    Evernym hosted cloud service which facilitates provisioning and management of cloud agents - Evernym tokenizer service, provisioning protocol, agent management for all other protocols

- Provision Token \
    This token is provided by a sponsor to enable provisioning of an Evernym hosted cloud agent.
    ```json
     {
       "sponseeId":     String,
       "sponsorId":     String,
       "nonce":         String,
       "timestamp":     String,
       "sig":           String,
       "sponsorVerKey": String,
   
     } 
    ```
    `sponseeId`:
     An identifier a Sponsor uses to identify/reference the sponsee. This can be a customer id used to identify the sponsee in the sponsor’s back end database. \
    `sponsorId`: 
     The persistent id given to the sponsor when the sponsor works with Evernym TE to register the configuration. \
    `nonce`:
    Randomly generated string. 
    **Example**. random.number.toString() or random.uuid() \
    `timestamp`:
    An RFC 3339 and ISO 8601 date and time string such as `1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00`. \
    `sig`:
    The sponsor signs the timeStamp + the nonce + customerId and encodes it to a base64 encoded string. The Sponsor uses the signing keys associated with the `Evernym Agency` registered verkey to perform the signature. 
    **Example** Base64Encode(Sign(nonce + timestamp + id)) \
    `sponsorVerKey`: 
    Sponsor’s verkey associated with the signing keys. 
    
- Vcx Config: used in `vcx_get_provision_token` and `vcx_provision_agent_with_token`
    ```json
      {
        protocol_type: String
        agency_url: String,
        pub agency_did: String,
        agency_verkey: String,
        wallet_name: Option<String>,
        wallet_key: String,
        wallet_type: Option<String>,
        agent_seed: Option<String>,
        enterprise_seed: Option<String>,
        wallet_key_derivation: Option<String>,
        name: Option<String>,
        logo: Option<String>,
        path: Option<String>,
        storage_config: Option<String>,
        storage_credentials: Option<String>,
        pool_config: Option<String>,
        did_method: Option<String>,
        communication_method: Option<String>,
        webhook_url: Option<String>,
        use_latest_protocols: Option<String>,
    }
    ```

### Sponsor Registration with Evernym's Agency 
- Currently sponsors will need to interact out of band with Evernym to register with its Agency. Eventually, it's possible that a protocol may facilitate this interaction. 
- Registration requires the sponsor to provide these attribute to Evernym’s TE department: 
    ```json
      {
        "name": "String",
        "id": "String",
        "keys": [{"verKey":"VK"}],
        "endpoint": "String",
        "active": boolean 
      }
    ```
    `name`: The name of the Sponsor who endorses the provisioning . \
    `id`: An ID which will not change. Keys cannot be used because of rotation possibilities. (May be assigned by TE) \
    `keys`: VerKey associated with the signing of the token and used to verify a sponsee’s provision token. 
     - The signing keys (including the verkey shared with Evernym's Agency) can be generated using this simple tool: `https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/launch/raw/master/sovrin-keygen.zip` 
     - The Private keys need to be stored in a safe place under control of the sponsor 
     - The public verkey will be shared with Evernym for signature validation.
     
    `endpoint`: Sponsor's URL that Evernym Agency should forward sponsee messages to. \
    `active`: If the sponsor has an active status with Evernym's Agency
    
### Mobile SDK - 3rd party apps (`Sponsee`)
1. Obtaining Provision Token
    - An app will have to communicate with its `sponsor` to receive a `token`. 
    - This `token` will contain a signature generated by the `sponsor` to ensure the provisioning application (`sponsee`) has authorization to do so.
    - It also contains a timestamp. If the token isn’t delivered to Evernym's Agency in a predefined time frame, the token will be invalid. The `sponsee` will need to request another `token` from its `sponsor`.
    - If for whatever reason provisioning fails, the `sponsee` should request a new `token` from its `sponsor` and attempt provisioning again. 
2. Provisioning
    - **** Same steps as previous provision except that the token needs to be included. 
    - If a wallet is already configured before the provision, this wallet will be used. If not, a new one will be created.
    - The configuration returned from this api will be the input for `vcx_init`. At this point, the app will be provisioned on Evernym's Agency with a cloud agent and will have a local wallet initialized but NOT open. `Vcx_init` will open the wallet.

3. Receiving Future Messages
    - Sponsee will need to call update_com_method \
      `id`: String - Sponsee's Id, \
      `type`: Int - Com Method Type (ALWAYS `3` for forwarding), \
      `value`: String 
      - Sponsee messages are forwarded to the Sponsor. `value` will be the whatever information the Sponsor's back-end will need to deliver that message to the sponsee.  
      - When Evernym's Agency receives a message for this entity (through provisioned cloud agent), the cloud agent will forward the message to the sponsor. The Sponsor will the deliver the message to the sponsee with whatever mechanism it already uses to communicate with its customer.  
    - The cloud agent will forward messages to the Sponsor’s back-end vi http. No A2A encryption will be added. The http message will include:
        1. `msgId`:  This is the id that the sponsee will use to actually download the message
        2. `sponseeDetails`: Sponsee messages are forwarded to the Sponsor. This will be the whatever information the Sponsor's back-end will need to deliver that message to the sponsee.  
        3. `sponseePwDid`
        4. `metaData` - message sender's name, did, and logo. This is used mostly to display the message for the sponsee.
        ```json 
       {
         msgId: String,
         sponseeDetails: String, 
         sponseePwDid: String,
         metaData: {
           senderName: String,
           senderDid: String,
           logoUrl: String
         }
       } 
        ```
    - The sponsor will then push notify the sponsee informing that a message is available and ready to be downloaded from the sponsee's cloud agent. 

### CMe Sponsee
1. Obtaining Provision Token
    1. A wallet will be necessary to obtain an Evernym signed provision token. If a wallet is already created before the token request, this wallet will be used. If not, a new one will be created. This wallet can be deleted after because the permanent keys are inserted during the provisioning process. At a minimum the wallet needs to be closed (`vcx_shutdown(true)`)
    2. `vcx_get_provision_token` takes a configuration: 
        ```json 
         {
            "vcx_config": Vcx Config (defined above),         
            "source_id": String,
            "com_method": {
                "type": u32, // 1 is the only supported type. 1 is for push notifications.
                "id": String,
                "value": String, // this is the actual push notification address
            }
         }
        ```
        **Example**: {"type": 1,"id":"123","value":"FCM:Value"}
      
   3.  Authentication: The approach that Evernym's Agency is taking for authentication is that if a token request comes in, the response will be sent via push notification to only CMe. No other apps will receive this token because of the firebase key.
   
        - A better authentication approach will happen eventually. 
        - If the token is not received, delete the wallet <shutdown(true)> and ask for a new token. 
        
2. Provisioning
    1. Deleting the wallet (or at least closing it) should happen before re-attempting this
        - delete wallet: vcx_shutdown(true) 
        - close wallet: vcx_shutdown(false) 

    2. If a wallet is already configured before the provision, this wallet will be used. If not, a new one will be created.
    3. **** Same steps as previous provision except that the token needs to be included. 
    4. The configuration returned from this api will be what is passed into vcx_init. At this point, the app will be provisioned on Evernym's Agency with a cloud agent and will have a local wallet initialized but NOT open. Vcx_init will open the wallet.
    5. Update com method
    
3. Receiving Future Messages
    - update com method

### iOS
Refer to  `mobile-starter-master/ios/CMeSdkObjc/CMeSdkObjc/AppDelegate.m` <!--[Q2] Should they open this file for editing?-->

### Android
Refer to `init()` in `mobile-starter-master/android/CMeSdkJava/app/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/ConnectMeVcx.java` <!--Should they open this file for editing?-->

1. Initialize `VcxLogger` to use the default logger or a custom logger.

2. Save the pool-transactions genesis configuration JSON to a file. The contents of the `*poolTxnGenesis NSString` variable will be similar to the contents shown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis)<!--[Q3] That's a lot of text: will theirs contain that much text?-->. The path to the pool-transactions genesis file is used in the function call to initialize the SDK.

3. Invoke the payment-initialization function. (For now this is `nullPay`). Note that this call is not asynchronous.

4. Invoke the `agentProvisionAsync` function to get the `oneTimeInfo` configuration.

5. Get the `vcxConfig` JSON from the keychain keystore if the `oneTimeInfo` JSON is null. If the `oneTimeInfo` JSON is not null then create the `vcxConfig` JSON using the `oneTimeInfo` JSON.

6. Initialize the VCX native library so that you can now use the SDK APIs that give you access to the wallet. Please note that we are using `[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];` as the temporary storage mechanism in this Objective C code, but you should use a more robust storage and retrieval mechanism as a permanent solution.

7. Verify that your mobile app still builds, links, and deploys onto a real mobile device. Run some tests to ensure that everything works up to this point. 

> **NOTE:** If the initialization of the wallet does not work after you followed these steps, please contact Evernym. If you had to do extra steps to get it working, please also let us know what you had to do so that we can update this document.


## Selecting the Ledger and Agency

#### Ledger

If you want to use a different Ledger, you *must* change to the corresponding Agency as described in the *Agency* section below.

1. Change the contents of the `poolTxnGenesis` variable in the above code. <!--[Q4] Do you mean the files above that they "refer to"?-->Evernym has several active Ledger instances that we use for different scenarios: 
`development
sandbox
staging
demo
qatest1
qatest2
devrc
qarc
devteam1
devteam2
devteam2
prod`

   * You can find an older configuration for some of these ledgers [here](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app/blob/master/app/store/config-store.js).
  
   * Search for `server_environment` to see some of these instances.

3. Use the `poolConfig:` setting in the particular environment to set the `poolTxnGenesis` variable to the value of the `poolConfig:` setting. If you  want to use a different Ledger other than `demo`, which is what the above code uses, then please let us know. <!--[Q5] Do they need to ask Evernym for permission or instructions to use a different Ledger, or do they talk to us if they want to use a different Ledger than in the list in Step 1?-->

#### Agency
If you choose to use a different Ledger then you *must* change to the corresponding Agency and vice-versa. 

* To use a different Agency, change the contents of the `agencyConfig` variable in the above code. 

* For every different Ledger configuration there is a corresponding Agency configuration. These configuration settings can be seen in the same `config-store.js` code that was linked in the Ledger section above. 

* You will need to change `agency_did`, `agency_url`, and `agency_verkey` in the code above to use a different Agency for the corresponding Ledger.

<!--[Q6] Who will provide the info for this section? > TODO: NOTE about had issues were here where NSString *walletName = @"wallet_name"; had to be changed and NSString *fileName = @"pool_transactions_genesis_DEMO";-->
