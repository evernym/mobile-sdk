# 2. Initializing the Wallet

Almost all of the iOS APIs provided by the Connect.Me iOS SDK are asynchronous, which means that a completion callback function is required to get the results of the function invocations. This page contains the steps to initialize the wallet. Most of these wallet initialization steps are done in the AppDelegateâ€™s `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` life cycle method. <!--[Q1] What about Android?-->

<!--![](https://github.com/evernym/mobile-starter/blob/master/wiki-images/InitializingWalletConnectMe.png)This illustration is not helpful because it is not a decision tree-->

### iOS
Refer to  `mobile-starter-master/ios/CMeSdkObjc/CMeSdkObjc/AppDelegate.m` <!--[Q2] Should they open this file for editing?-->

### Android
Refer to `init()` in `mobile-starter-master/android/CMeSdkJava/app/src/main/java/me/connect/sdk/java/ConnectMeVcx.java` <!--Should they open this file for editing?-->

1. Initialize `VcxLogger` to use the default logger or a custom logger.

2. Save the pool-transactions genesis configuration JSON to a file. The contents of the `*poolTxnGenesis NSString` variable will be similar to the contents shown [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis)<!--[Q3] That's a lot of text: will theirs contain that much text?-->. The path to the pool-transactions genesis file is used in the function call to initialize the SDK.

3. Invoke the payment-initialization function. (For now this is `nullPay`). Note that this call is not asynchronous.

4. Invoke the `agentProvisionAsync` function to get the `oneTimeInfo` configuration.

5. Get the `vcxConfig` JSON from the keychain keystore if the `oneTimeInfo` JSON is null. If the `oneTimeInfo` JSON is not null then create the `vcxConfig` JSON using the `oneTimeInfo` JSON.

6. Initialize the VCX native library so that you can now use the SDK APIs that give you access to the wallet. Please note that we are using `[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];` as the temporary storage mechanism in this Objective C code, but you should use a more robust storage and retrieval mechanism as a permanent solution.

7. Verify that your mobile app still builds, links, and deploys onto a real mobile device. Run some tests to ensure that everything works up to this point. 

> **NOTE:** If the initialization of the wallet does not work after you followed these steps, please contact Evernym. If you had to do extra steps to get it working, please also let us know what you had to do so that we can update this document.


## Selecting the Ledger and Agency

#### Ledger

If you want to use a different Ledger, you *must* change to the corresponding Agency as described in the *Agency* section below.

1. Change the contents of the `poolTxnGenesis` variable in the above code. <!--[Q4] Do you mean the files above that they "refer to"?-->Evernym has several active Ledger instances that we use for different scenarios:  

`development
sandbox
staging
demo
qatest1
qatest2
devrc
qarc
devteam1
devteam2
devteam2
prod`

   * You can find an older configuration for some of these ledgers [here](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app/blob/master/app/store/config-store.js).
  
   * Search for `server_environment` to see some of these instances.

2. Use the `poolConfig:` setting in the particular environment to set the `poolTxnGenesis` variable to the value of the `poolConfig:` setting. If you  want to use a different Ledger other than `demo`, which is what the above code uses, then please let us know. <!--[Q5] Do they need to ask Evernym for permission or instructions to use a different Ledger, or do they talk to us if they want to use a different Ledger than in the list in Step 1?-->

#### Agency
If you choose to use a different Ledger then you *must* change to the corresponding Agency and vice-versa. 

* To use a different Agency, change the contents of the `agencyConfig` variable in the above code. 

* For every different Ledger configuration there is a corresponding Agency configuration. These configuration settings can be seen in the same `config-store.js` code that was linked in the Ledger section above. 

* You will need to change `agency_did`, `agency_url`, and `agency_verkey` in the code above to use a different Agency for the corresponding Ledger.

<!--[Q6] Who will provide the info for this section? > TODO: NOTE about had issues were here where NSString *walletName = @"wallet_name"; had to be changed and NSString *fileName = @"pool_transactions_genesis_DEMO";-->

## Push notifications setup

For in more depth information how push notifications works in one of the platforms, you can read official documentation sections for: 
   
   - Android: [https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications)
   - iOS: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/ 

From Vcx and cloud agent perspective, you will need to link received **push notification token** you received on your device with your cloud agent in Vcx, so notifications will be sent to correct device. 

We also recommend using Firebase Cloud Messaging, since it's provide universal configuration for both platforms (iOS and Android): https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client. 

How to link your push notification with VCX cloud agent? 

For the moment, sending push notifications should happen from user's cloud agent (which will receive notification from Evernym cloud agent) so all mobile device tokens are stored on your side, safely and securely.

We are working also on improving service related to push notifications, we should have more details soon. 

In meantime, you can use method ```downloadMessages``` in ObjC or ```UtilsApi.vcxGetMessages``` in Java, for pulling all messages waiting on cloud agent. Parameters for this method are as follows:
```
messageStatus: optional, comma separated - query for messages with the specified status.
  Statuses:
   MS-101 - Created
   MS-102 - Sent
   MS-103 - Received
   MS-104 - Accepted
   MS-105 - Rejected
   MS-106 - Reviewed

uids: optional, comma separated - query for messages with the specified uids.

pwdids: optional, comma separated - DID's pointing to specific connection.
```

> ObjC
```
[appDelegate.sdkApi downloadMessages:@"MS-103" uid_s:nil pwdids:pw_did completion:^(NSError *error, NSString *messages) {
}
```



<!-- After wallet initialization Vcx with specific configuration (steps from above), you just need to call a method **updateAgentInfo** and provide details of your deviceID and push notification token, in this format: 

```
   { uniqueId: '{deviceID}', pushToken: 'FCM:{pushToken}' }
``` -->

<!-- ### iOS: 

> In same file with wallet initialization steps, eg. AppDelegate.m 

```ObjectiveC
[appDelegate.sdkApi agentUpdateInfo:pushNotifConfig completion:^(NSError *error) {
   if (error != nil && error.code != 0)
   {
         NSString *indyErrorCode = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%ld", (long)error.code];
         NSLog(@"3) Value of indyErrorCode is: %@", indyErrorCode);
   } else {
         NSLog(@"Updated the push notification token to: %@", tokenString);
   }
}];
``` -->

<!-- ### Android: 

> In same file with wallet initialization steps, eg. ConnectMeVCX.java -->

<!-- ```java
UtilsApi.vcxUpdateAgentInfo(config).exceptionally((t) -> {
   promise.reject("FutureException", t.getMessage());
      return -1;
   }).thenAccept(result -> {
   if (result != -1) {
      BridgeUtils.resolveIfValid(promise, result);
   }
});
``` -->
