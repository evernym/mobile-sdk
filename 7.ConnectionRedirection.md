# Connection Redirection

With adding more and more connections, its getting hard for user to remember which connections are already established. There is potential that some of the new connections user tries to establish already exists in list of connections (e.g. QR code was scanned multiple types). In this case we should not create new connection and try to reuse existing one.

## Connection invite retrieval

To check does connection already exists, we need to retrieve invitation it was used during creation.

### 1. Deserialize connection

#### Android
```java
int connectionHandle = ConnectionApi.connectionDeserialize(serializedConnection).get();
```

### 2. Get invite details

#### Android
```java
String connectionInvite = ConnectionApi.connectionInviteDetails(handle, abbreviated).get();
```
`abbreviated` parameter takes values `0` or `1`. For `0` it will return full names of invite fields, or shortened names for `1`.

## Compare proprietary invite

Proprietary invite will have `id` field in the invitation.
In this case for new invite and connection invite `senderDetail.DID` fields should be compared (`s.d` for abbreviated versions)

## Proprietary connection redirection.

In case both invite DIDs are equal, redirection process should  be performed:

### 1. Deserialize connection

#### Android
```java
int existingConnectionHandle = ConnectionApi.connectionDeserialize(serializedConnection).get();
```

### 2. Create connection with new invite

#### Android
```java
int newConnectionHandle = ConnectionApi.vcxCreateConnectionWithInvite(invitationId, newInvite).get();
```

### 3. Redirect connection

#### Android
```java
int newConnectionHandle = ConnectionApi.vcxConnectionRedirect(newConnectionHandle, existingConnectionHandle).get();
```


## Compare aries invites

Aries invtes should contain `@id` and `@type` fields that are matching

## Aries invite redirection

Depending on connection existence and availablity of `handshake_protocols` and `request~attach` fields in new invite, different actions should be taken.

### 1. Deserialize connection

#### Android
```java
int existingConnectionHandle = ConnectionApi.connectionDeserialize(serializedConnection).get();
```

### 2. Send connection reuse

#### Android
```java
 ConnectionApi.connectionSendReuse(existingConnectionHandle, newInvite).get();
```
